Random bits of coding, for someone to hack on.
When something's done, delete the line from this file
and check in your code with the deletion.

bitops.h - expand to bitops.c (write a bitset type for arbitrarily sized bitmaps)
sexp.h - write a sexp parser (interface and format are given)
hashtable.h - expand to hashtable.c (write a hashtable implementation for strings or 64-bit ints)
