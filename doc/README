This directory holds or will hold the documentation, design documents
and random notes about Altitude. Some files and directories are:


spec/
 - the spec document

TASKS
 - a list of things which can be done by whoever has a bit of spare
 time to hack on them. The format is one task per line, and delete the
 line when you're done. The edit that creates the line should be
 checked-in in the same commit that created the task, and the edit
 that deletes it checked in with the code that performs the task.

style
 - some notes about coding style. Update whenever you feel like it or
 if you have an idea which would make the code easier to understand.
