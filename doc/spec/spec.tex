\chapter{Introduction}

\section{What this is}
Altitude is our reversible interpreter for the C programming language. The goal of the project is to build a teaching environment which will provide a safety net for C programmers, consisting of a minimal development environment with extensive debugging support. The various nooks and crannies of C are hard to learn for a novice programmer.
\section{Why this is cool}
There are nigh-innumerable ways to shoot oneself in the foot when programming in C. For starters, thereâ€™s subtle bugs like taking the address of a stack variable and returning it, or double-freeing some memory. Both of these will often work depending on things like underlying C library, compiler optimisation levels, whether any other functions are called before the invalid pointer is dereferenced (who knows, the data may still happen to be on the stack). The seemingly random nature of these bugs makes them very difficult to diagnose for an inexperienced programmer. By maintaining state for every allocated object, these bugs could be detected early and reliably during the execution of the program. Another class of bug is the code which works totally reliably on a given system but accidentally depends on some platform-specific behaviour and is in fact invalid as ISO C code. Examples of this include indexing into an array with a char variable (as the signedness of char is implementation-specified).
\par
This project aims to prevent a significant amount of bugs derived from a novice's lack of in-depth understanding of how C works. There are many cases where even experienced users are driven to frustration by subtle differences in how code is handled, and nobody should have to know exactly how every compiler their program may ever be run on will handle their code. To this end, our aims are to prevent implementation-specific code from being written, and to provide reasons why any given error is, in fact, an error.
\section{Why this is hard}

The specification of the C language is much less defined than, say, Java or Python. Many questionable constructs, instead of causing an error, may or may not cause the program to fail. Equally many questionable constructs are entirely valid in C and give well-defined results.

The vagueness of the specified behaviour of C in many areas is mostly due to a concern for efficiency. Imagine the efficiency of the code an optimiser could produce if it were allowed, even encouraged, to break in edge cases! It also means that the usual approach to some unknown facet of the language (write a small test-case, run it, see what happens) is entirely meaningless in C, as what happens may vary from compiler to compiler if it invokes some of the undefined parts of the C standard.

\subsection{C's Taxonomy of Failure}
C code can fail in various different ways. There is no uniform error reporting for this, in fact errors aren't necessarily detected. Again, this is for efficiency. Accurate programmers can write code that runs without wasting time on checking, say, array bounds.

The types of unusual behaviour for a C program, as defined in the Standard, are:
\begin{description}
\item[Implementation-defined behaviour] This is some aspect of the language which the C standard leaves up to the particular implementation, with the proviso that each implementation must make a definite, documented choice. This is usually used in cases where there are multiple choices, and which is more efficient or easier to implement depends on historical baggage, or the underlying hardware. A typical example is whether or not the ``char'' type is signed.

Programs are often targetted to a particular platform, in which case relying on implementation-defined behaviour is valid. However, portable programs must not rely on it.

\item[Unspecified behaviour] This means that an implementation of C is free to choose from a well-defined set of choices. It doesn't have to document its choice, nor must it be consistent in choosing. This is usually used to give extra latitude for program transformation to optimising compilers. If a compiler knows in advance that it is allowed to make certain changes, it needn't bother to prove that the change won't affect the semantics of the program. A typical example is the order of evaluation of function arguments.

Programs can invoke unspecified behaviour (it's generally hard to avoid), but should produce the same results whichever choice the C implementation makes.

\item[Undefined behaviour] This means that anything can happen, according to a famous Usenet post it may cause ``demons to fly up your nose''. This is a bug in a C program. Since C programs do no error-checking other than that explicity written by the programmer, undefined behaviour can do anything. Common behaviours are program termination by segfault or similar, and silent data corruption.

Programs must avoid undefined behaviour, a program whose function is unknown is not particularly useful. Most bugs in C programs manifest themselves as undefined behaviour resulting in abnormal termination or segfaults.
\end{description}

Altitude is designed to show up any bugs in the program, and give the user an opportunity to understand and debug them. To this end, it tries to be as evil as possible in implementation-defined and unspecified behaviour (so that the bugs are more likely to appear), and as nice as possible in undefined behaviour (typically by giving a very detailed description of the undefined behaviour, rather than ``Segmentation fault.''.

An example of being-evil is Altitude's choice that ``char'' is signed. This will break programs that naively try to use characters as array indices, to, say, count character frequencies.


\section{Structure}
\subsection{Compiler}
The compiler in Altitude is written in OCaml, since the CIL library we're using is written in that language. Its purpose is to translate user-input C programs into a simplified s-expression syntax. For an explanation of the s-expressions we use, see the section entitled Compiler, later in the document.
\subsection{Virtual Machine Model}

\subsubsection{Patches}
Patches are our model of the execution of C programs, explained in great depth and detail in the VM Model section of this document. 

A summary then: a patch in the context of the virtual machine is a difference between two states of the program. A state of the program includes things like the call stack and the local and global variables visible at a given time. Patches are bi-directional, which means you can utilise the same patch to go from a notional state one to state two and also to go from state two to state one. Execution of a program then can be viewed as a long string of patch applications, to get from the initial empty state to the end state. 

One of the most useful and brilliant things about patches is that because they represent differences they can can be merged together to form a larger patch, still going between two notional states, but this time, those states are not adjacent in the actual execution of the program. This built-in compression of sorts is very useful, because, for example, you might not want to keep patches for each recursive step of a heavily recursive function, which might make thousands of recursive calls, but you do want to be able to step back over the computation. It's possible to simply merge each patch created as a recursive call executes with the patch taken as the function is first called, and you'll have a patch that goes straight from function call to result.

Patches are explained in depth in the Patches subsection of the VM Model pages.
\subsubsection{Pointers}
Pointers in the context of the VM are more than just the C pointers they represent. They have information stored with them to aid in the debugging of pointer operations performed by the interpreted program.

The internal structure of a pointer in the context of the virtual machine is;
\begin{itemize}
\item the blob they point to 
\item a "path", which describes the part of the blob that they refer to (e.g. "the foo member of the 4th struct in the array stored in this blob"
\item a unique ID
\item a top-type (explained in the VM Model section)
\end{itemize}
