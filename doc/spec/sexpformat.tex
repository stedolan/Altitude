\chapter{S-Expression Intermediate Representation}
C code is loaded into the VM in an s-expression based format. This file and sexp.c define parsing and manipulation functions for Altitude's sexps. The format isn't quite standard Lisp-like sexps.

\section{Grammar}
A sexp in Altitude looks like this (in approximate EBNF.)
 
\begin{list}{}{}
\item sexp := '(' 
\item ($\langle$location$\rangle$ $\langle$ws$\rangle$)?
\item $\langle$tag$\rangle$
\item ($\langle$ws$\rangle$ ($\langle$sexp$\rangle$ $\vert$ $\langle$string$\rangle$ $\vert$ $\langle$int$\rangle$))*
\item $\langle$ws$\rangle$? ')'
\item
\item location := '@' $\langle$string$\rangle$ ':' $\langle$int$\rangle$ ':' $\langle$int$\rangle$
\item
\item int := [0-9]+ [a decimal non-negative integer, fits in a 64-bit unsigned int]
\item
\item string := a double-quoted string, where backslash is the escape character and double-quote and backslash are escaped.
\item
\item ws := any amount of newline, carriage return, tab or space
\item
\item tag := 'STRUCT' $\vert$ 'UNION' $\vert$ 'LOOP'
\end{list}

So, a sexp is an opening parenthesis, followed by optional location
information, followed by a tag, followed by any number of children
which are each integers, quoted strings or themselves sexps,
followed by a closing parenthesis.

\section{Location Information}
Location information is of the form: @"somefile.c":20:500 which means character 500 which is on line 20 of the file
"somefile.c". It is optional.
