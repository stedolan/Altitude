\chapter{Patches}
\section{Patch theory}
Patches and state, forming a group
\section{Patch List}
Reversing, iterating. Current position in list, flipping back and
forth along list. Step-backward (go back a patch, run forward).
\section{Serializability}
Swapping out for RAM pressure, mailing files of bugs to devs (does
this fit with the teaching perspective? hehe, mail coredumps to TAs).
\section{Patch structures}
\subsection{Call tree}
Patches are tree-paths, merge and reverse have nice implementations.
\subsection{Blobs}
CRUD, merge, reverse.
\subsection{Pointers}
Patch the ptrtable.
