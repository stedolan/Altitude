/* 
 * S-Expressions in Altitude
 * C code is loaded into the VM in an s-expression based format. This
 * file and sexp.c define parsing and manipulation functions for
 * Altitude's sexps.
 *
 * The format isn't quite standard Lisp-like sexps. A sexp in Altitude
 * looks like this (in approximate EBNF): 
 *  
 * sexp := '('
 *              (<location> <ws>)?
 *              <tag>
 *              (<ws> (<sexp> | <string> | <int>))* 
 *          <ws>? ')'
 * location := '@' <string> ':' <int> ':' <int>
 * int := [0-9]+ [a decimal non-negative integer, fits in a 64-bit unsigned int]
 * string := a double-quoted string, where backslash is the escape character
 *           and double-quote and backslash are escaped.
 * ws := any amount of newline, carriage return, tab or space
 * tag := one of the tags defined below
 * 
 * So, a sexp is an opening parenthesis, followed by optional location
 * information, followed by a tag, followed by any number of children
 * which are each integers, quoted strings or themselves sexps,
 * followed by a closing parenthesis.
 * 
 * Location information is of the form:
 *     @"somefile.c":20:500 
 * which means character 500 which is on line 20 of the file
 * "somefile.c". It is optional.
