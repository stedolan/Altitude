/* Instruction format
 *
 * Many instructions require a type. For instance, addition of two
 * "int"s is subtly different from addition of two "char"s
 * (e.g. detecting overflow and the like). So, many operations carry
 * both and opcode and a type. There are no mixed-mode operations in
 * Altitude (e.g. in C you can do long x = (int)y +
 * (short)z). Instead, explicit casts are inserted to make all of the
 * operand types the same (there are subtle issues for shift
 * operators, however, as their operands do not have the same type).
 *
 * The "types" in question are just the primitive types (see primtype
 * in memtypes.h), not the full machinery of the Altitude type system
 * (as you can't, say, add two structs in C).
 * 
 * Instructions are stored as 16-bit unsigned integers.
 * The top byte holds the opcode, the bottom byte holds the type of
 * the operands, if specified. Otherwise it is 0.
 *
 * Some instructions take immediate, fixed operands. These are
 * inserted inline into the instruction stream. For instance, the
 * "instruction" following a JUMP_ALWAYS is not an instruction but a
 * 16-bit signed offset into the code array.
